                    <h1>Digital Inequalities / CSS</h1>
                    <p>
                        <h2>My Continuous Website Development-</h2><p>This week I looked at my website's CSS code and compared the differences and similarities to the practical lecture content as I have used flexboxes and different units of measurement such as px and rem in my code with only a basic understanding of how these functions operate. These are all in preparation for Assignment 3. In terms of my website content, I have completed most of my essay that will be added to the essay placeholder after submission.</p> 
                        <h2>Reflection on the reading <q>Making A Feminist Internet In Africa: Why The Internet Needs African Feminists And Feminisms</q> by Sheena Magenya-</h2><p class="p-name">For my close reading a took a look at <cite><a href="https://www.genderit.org/editorial/making-feminist-internet-africa-why-internet-needs-african-feminists-and-feminisms"> <b><em><q>Making A Feminist Internet In Africa: Why The Internet Needs African Feminists And Feminisms</q></em></b></a></cite><b> by Sheena Magenya</b> which focuses on the intersection of gender, technology, and culture in Africa, and the ways in which a feminist approach to the internet can promote social justice and gender equality. The close reading focuses on the role of technology in our society, and the ways in how gender and other forms of identity intersect within this system.  The article provides an argument that the internet in Africa is currently characterized by gender-based violence, exclusion, and discrimination, and that a feminist approach is necessary to address these issues and ensure that the internet is accessible and equitable for all.</p>
                        <p>One of the key insights from the article is that technology is not neutral but is developed by social and political factors. The argument is that the dominant models of technology development and implementation are often driven by profit and do not consider the needs and experiences of marginalized groups, including women and gender non-conforming individuals. As a result, the internet in Africa can reproduce and reinforce existing power structures and inequalities, rather than challenging them.</p>
                        <p>The author highlights the ways in which gender-based violence, such as online harassment and cyberstalking, are prevalent on the internet in Africa and how this can have a chilling effect on women's participation and freedom of expression online. They also discuss the ways in which traditional gender roles and stereotypes can be reinforced by technology, and the importance of challenging these norms to promote gender equality.</p>
                        <p>The article provides more insight that a feminist approach to the internet is necessary to ensure that it is inclusive, equitable, and accessible to all, particularly those who have traditionally been marginalized or excluded. The authors propose a range of strategies to achieve this, including promoting digital literacy, developing feminist technological practices, and engaging in policy and advocacy work.</p>
