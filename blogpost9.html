                        <h2>My Continuous Website Development-</h2><p>I haven't made any physical changes to my website yet, but I have done more research on how I would like to incorporate JavaScript into my website. I would like to make the entire navigation bar into JavaScript along with adding a search bar so that users are able to search for any specific information/content they are looking for. I would also like to make my blog posts and design posts overview with JavaScript to reduce the amount of Divs in my html syntax. I am not very confident in my JavaScript skills so Iâ€™ve been going through and doing the class exercises to figure out exactly how I will adapt my code into JavaScript syntax. This will hopefully allow my interaction design to smooth out as I also must take into consideration the media queries I will be adjusting to.</p> 
                        <h2>Reflection on the reading <q>Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory asnSociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence</q>by Mohammed.S et al. -</h2><p>The paper <b><q>Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical Practice</q></b> offers a thought-provoking perspective on the intersection of decolonial theory and artificial intelligence <dfn>(AI)</dfn>. The main theme throughout this paper is that AI technologies should be analyzed and developed through a decolonial lens, highlighting the power dynamics, biases, and inequalities inherent in AI systems.</p>
                        <p>Emphasis is placed on the challenging the Eurocentric and colonial foundations of AI. The authors critique the dominant narratives and epistemologies that form AI research and development, highlighting the need to better Western knowledge systems and include diverse cultural perspectives. By doing so, a more inclusive and equitable approach to AI that considers the experiences and values of marginalized communities is developed.</p>
                        <p>The authors delve into the concept of "epistemic disobedience" as a means of disrupting dominant AI narratives. The decolonial AI requires questioning and challenging existing norms and assumptions in AI research, which often perpetuate social inequalities. By actively engaging with diverse knowledge systems and integrating non-Western epistemologies, the authors suggest that AI can move beyond reproducing colonial structures and contribute to more socially just outcomes.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, a collaborative approach to AI research and development is indicated. They emphasize the importance of engaging with local communities, particularly those directly affected by AI technologies, and involving them in decision-making processes. This participatory approach aims to challenge the top-down nature of AI development and ensure that the voices and needs of marginalized groups are heard and respected.</p>
                        <p>While reading this paper, I found myself questioning the assumptions and biases underlying AI systems that I had previously taken for granted. The authors provide a valuable critique of the field and offer practical suggestions for decolonizing AI. They remind us that AI is not a neutral tool but a product of human design, embedded with societal values and power dynamics. Thus, also encouraging researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to critically reflect on the impact of AI and strive for a decolonial approach to bring about a more inclusive and ethically grounded AI ecosystem that addresses historical injustices and promotes social equity.</p>
