                        <p class="blog-text">This week I was introduced to this course with the idea of what the world wide web is about and how we can build and develop websites. We explored the readings which are "As We May Think" and the “Library of Babel” as well as “The Garden of Forking Paths” which were interesting in terms of how the idea of the internet was mapped out before coming into existence. I also learnt how to utilize Github and what my goals for this course are.</p>

                        <p class="blog-text">This week I began my journey learning, researching, and coding in HTML. My reflection of this week's reading was on Bruce Lawson's articles and Wardrip-Fruin's "What Hypertext Is" which was in connection to last week’s article on "As We May Think". My reflection on Internet Histories is based on how the modern internet came into existence and that there are both advantages and disadvantages of dynamic webpages.</p>

I used resources such as YouTube to browse ideas for my website. The reading Mailloux’s article, “Convention and Context” was linked to UI and UX in many aspects of interactivity, user-friendly and easy navigation. I also gave my thoughts about the supplementary material being provided to me is extremely beneficial in correlation to my live lectures.</p>

I had to re-analyse my approach to developing my website by changing up my wireframes and colour schemes a user interface is extremely important for a great user experience. User interface in terms of interactivity was placed with great importance this week as it constitutes towards effective user experience and design. My reading reflection was focused on interface design and how interface technology have the same goal in perspective with different approaches.</p>

I focused more attention to completing my wireframe design and in general the development my website in terms of design. I paid careful attention to the colours, fonts, and display that I want to use for my website. I mainly focused on how I want to go about building my website throughout the next 2 weeks. I also watched a documentary called “The Social Dilemma” which is about social media and how technology has become a huge influence over our life. As a student of this course, I was deeply affected by the documentary I watched, as it opened my eyes to a new perspective.</p>
