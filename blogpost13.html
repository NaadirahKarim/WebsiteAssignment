                    <p>
                        <h2>The API I chose-</h2><p>The API I chose to add to my exam submission was a motivational quote API. I debated between adding a custom search engine API or the Dad Jokes API that Andre used as an example in class. The reason why I chose this particular API was to indirectly provide users with motivation through the quotes they view. The quotes generated may end up being something they needed to read, offering encouragement for whatever they are going through in life. I placed this API in my portfolio section because I believe that's where most of my hard work is present, and used motivational quotes when I needed motivation to complete some of those projects. Sometimes, motivational quotes were what kept me from giving up. As a last minute decision I added onto my website a custom google search engine bar that allows the user to search up anything they would like to know using this google API. For example, definitions of words, accessing articles, github repositories, etc.</p> 
                        <h2>Course Material Reflection-</h2>
                        <h3>Theory Reflection-</h3> <p> As an engineering student, I didn't realize how important theory would be in a web development course. Through this course, I've come to understand that to achieve practical results, one should first explore the underlying theory before developing an idea. My understanding of the World Wide Web has completely changed, especially when it comes to user interface and user experience. The evolution from the internet's initial introduction to the incredible impact of AI on today's generation is fascinating yet somewhat daunting. AI's continued development brings both possibilities and challenges. One of the most significant areas of learning for me was gaining an in-depth understanding and engagement of the readings provided. I approached the subject matter with enthusiasm and curiosity, which allowed me to grasp complex concepts and theories that were previously unfamiliar to me. I would like to express my gratitude to the lecturer, Hanli Geyser, for delivering interesting theory lectures and opening my mind to various possibilities in shaping the future of the World Wide Web.</p>
                        <h3>Coding Reflection-</h3> <p> I was extremely excited to learn about coding in this web development course. As someone who only started properly learning how to code at university, I was initially afraid of making mistakes while coding. However, I quickly picked up HTML and CSS and felt confident in completing Assignment 1, as it helped me hone my coding skills. Unfortunately, JavaScript didn't have the same effect. I am still struggling to grasp how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) without inadvertently altering my website. While I understand the theory behind it, the practical implementation remains challenging. Nonetheless, I would like to extend my appreciation to Andre Gopal and the tutors for providing me with the opportunity to delve deeper into the coding world from a web developer's perspective and allowing me to create a complete website.</p>
                        <p>This semester has been an incredible journey of learning and self-discovery. I have acquired a wealth of knowledge, developed essential skills, and cultivated a mindset of lifelong learning. The course has also taught me valuable lessons about time management and self-discipline and has sharpened my critical and analytical skills. I am grateful for the opportunities presented by this course and look forward to applying what I have learned in both my academic and personal pursuits.</p>
