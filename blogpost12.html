                        <h2>My Continuous Website Development: APIs-</h2><p>I have been doing assignment 3, but from my assignment 1 feedback I am currently deciding how I would like to portray my profile portfolio page. I assumed my planning for that page would be a done by the idea I used for assignment 1, yet now I’m not so sure. I won’t be able to make many changes for Assignment 2 due to time constraints and being indecisive. I do not feel happy about submitting that, but I will present something more contextualised n engaging by the exam.</p> 
                        <p>I am still not fully comfortable with APIs yet and have done research into which one I would like to incorporate into my website. The API I currently considering is a JSON placeholder that contains fake data, I would incorporate this API to help with my search bar that currently only brings the user to the google homepage. The search bar would allow a user to search for any specific content across my website. Another API I am considering would be a quote generator to make my homepage a little more engaging allowing a user to feel motivated to check out my website.</p>
                        <h2>Reflection on the Readings <q>Digital Divide Widens</q> by Tataki and Glynos and <q>The Need for Global Internet Connectivity</q> by Claire Daniolou-</h2> 
                        <h3><q>Digital Divide Widens</q> by Tataki and Glynos</h3> <p class="p-name">The article titled <b><q>Digital Divide Widens</q> by Tataki and Glynos</b> presents a comprehensive examination of the increasing digital divide in society. The authors delve into the implications of this divide, particularly in the context of education, employment, and social inclusion. The authors highlight the exacerbation of existing inequalities due to the digital divide. As technology becomes increasingly intertwined with various aspects of our lives, those without access to digital resources are left further behind. This creates a vicious cycle where marginalized individuals and communities are deprived of essential opportunities for growth and development which is extremely unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>The significance of bridging the digital divide in education. With the rise of online learning and digital resources, students without access to technology face significant barriers to acquiring knowledge and skills, deepening educational inequalities, and hindering their ability to compete in the job market. The reliance on digital platforms for job searching and professional networking puts individuals without digital access at a severe disadvantage, exacerbating social and economic disparities.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the exclusion of marginalized communities from social and political participation due to the digital divide. As civic engagement and public discourse increasingly move online, those without digital access are marginalized from important conversations and decision-making processes, undermining the principles of democracy and social equality. Digital divide as a critical social issue calls for prioritizing initiatives that provide equitable access to digital resources and bridge the gap between the digitally privileged and disadvantaged. Efforts should focus on affordable internet access, digital literacy programs, and the availability of necessary technology in underserved communities. Technology companies and internet service providers are called upon to adopt socially responsible practices and invest in initiatives that promote digital inclusivity. Collaborative efforts between government, private sector, and civil society are seen as essential to tackle the challenges posed by the digital divide.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the immediate action to address the digital divide and ensure equitable access to digital resources for all members of society is essential. It serves as a reminder of the urgent need for a more inclusive and equitable digital landscape.</p>
                        <h3><q>The Need for Global Internet Connectivity</q> by Claire Daniolou</h3> <p class="p-name">The article <b><q>The Need for Global Internet Connectivity</q> by Claire Daniolou</b>presents a thought-provoking analysis of the importance of global internet connectivity and the potential benefits it brings to individuals, communities, and societies worldwide.</p> 
                        <p>The transformative power of internet connectivity in bridging various divides, such as the digital divide and the information divide is highlighted in this article. Access to the internet provides individuals with opportunities for education, economic empowerment, and social connectivity. It enables access to vast amounts of information, online learning platforms, and global communication networks that can significantly impact the lives of people around the world. The role of global internet connectivity in promoting inclusive development and reducing inequalities. It serves as a catalyst for economic growth and innovation, enabling individuals and communities to participate in the global digital economy. By connecting previously marginalized regions and populations, the internet can help address social disparities and provide new avenues for social and economic progress.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, there is importance of internet connectivity in promoting democracy, freedom of expression, and access to information. The internet empowers individuals to voice their opinions, engage in political discourse, and access unbiased news sources. It fosters an environment of transparency, accountability, and citizen participation, thereby strengthening democratic processes and human rights. As I reflect on this article, I am reminded of the challenges that still exist in achieving global internet connectivity. The article acknowledges the obstacles, such as infrastructure limitations, cost barriers, and policy constraints. It calls for collective efforts from governments, private sector entities, and international organizations to address these challenges and ensure equitable access to the internet for all. The article briefly touches upon the issue of the digital divide and the risks of existing inequalities. It reminds me of the potential negative consequences of unequal internet access and while global internet connectivity has the potential for immense benefits, it must be implemented in a way that ensures inclusivity and avoids further marginalization.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, <q>The Need for Global Internet Connectivity</q> presents a compelling argument for the importance of worldwide internet access. It emphasizes the transformative power of the internet in bridging divides, promoting inclusive development, fostering democracy, and expanding access to information. </p>
