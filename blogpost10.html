                    <h1>Decolonising Technology pt2 / Responsive Design</h1>
                    <p>
                        <h2>My Continuous Website Development-</h2>
                        <h3>CSS in relation to the HTML and JavaScript</h3><p>My HTML provides the structural foundation for various design elements of my webpage. CSS uses these design elements for visual style. The JavaScript is than responsible for the interactivity and dynamic behaviour between the HTML and CSS. In terms of my CSS in relation to HTML and JavaScript, I have been converting some design elements from the HTML to JavaScript for a more dynamic interaction in correlation to the styling and modifications from the CSS properties, specifically looking into and practicing DOM in my website’s code. So far, I have considered JavaScript to add or remove HTML classes, toggle visibility, or animate elements. JavaScript is employed to manipulate the DOM <dfn>(Document Object Model)</dfn>, which represents the structure of an HTML document, and modify CSS styles directly.</p>
                        <h3>Responsive Design- Challenges and Benefits</h3><p>Challenges that I have face with responsive design was testing and compatibility over different devices, especially accommodating the different screen sizes and media queries. It requires thorough testing and troubleshooting to address compatibility issues and ensure a seamless experience for all users accessing this website on different mobile devices. As well as design adjustments of font sizes, rearranging elements, or hiding certain content. Performance of a webpage’s loading time due to large images and complex layouts can make responsive design challenging, thus I have sized down my images. Performance optimization techniques, such as lazy loading, minification, and compression, are essential to maintain a fast and smooth user experience which I try to keep in mind when editing my code. Balancing aesthetics, functionality, and usability across various devices is an ongoing challenge in responsive design.</p>
                        <h2>Code Matters In Digital Colonialisms in Relation to The Lecture/Talk-</h2><p>The lecture/talk that was titled <strong><q>How We Code Matters: Introducing Critical Code Literacies</q> by Hanli Geyser</strong> was extremely insightful as emphasis was placed on the importance of understanding the societal impact of coding. Coding is not just a technical skill but a form of literacy that influences power dynamics. The ethical responsibilities of programmers and the potential consequences of their code, citing examples of biased algorithms and surveillance technologies. The integration of critical code literacy in education, professional training, and policy discussions to create a more inclusive and socially responsible technological landscape. This lecture opened my eyes into reflecting on my own decisions made for my website. I submitted a foundation that represented a bit of my personality with also presenting the seriousness of this course and its requirements. Unfortunately, I have only looked to the minimum requirements without questioning. I want to create a development project that will make passionate to keep going back and improving on it. For my next submission I have kept various ideas on how I would like to improve on my website whilst also considering the feedback that I received. My JavaScript coding skills are not good, but I do hope that I will be more confident in myself after finishing this website.</p>
