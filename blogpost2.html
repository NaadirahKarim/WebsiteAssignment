                    <h1>Internet Histories / HTML Fundamentals</h1>
                    <p>
                        <p></p><h2>My Experience Starting HTML-</h2> Initially I was anxious and thrilled. I am familiar with some coding languages, but this is my first-time using HTML. Learning this fundamental skill will contribute to the structural foundation of building a website. Initiatory, I was anxious by the syntax and the tags of HTML and how different the language would be to grasp compared to the other coding languages I've used. I find HTML interesting about the functionality of the tags and how they contribute to the performance of the website regarding the functions and display. I know with patience, practice, and persistence I will develop skills to create visually appealing and functional websites in the future.
                        <p></p> <h2>The Reading Reflections-</h2> The readings were tough to digest in association with Bruce Lawson's articles. After reading <b>Bruce Lawson's articles "Why You Should Choose HTML5" and "How A Screen Reader User Accesses The Web: A Smashing Video,"</b> the accessibility and user experience of web design namely HTML5 is extremely important as these beneficial aspects can impact the user's ability to access information. Screen reader users navigate the web and are essential to accessibility designs. 
                        <p></p>After reading <h3>Wardrip-Fruin's "What Hypertext Is"</h3> the hypertext connection between users and information is still highly applicable in this generation. Hypertext enhances accessibility by simplifying connections between related bits of information and the navigation from the user. Similarly, Harper's "As We May Think" intertwines with the idea of having information organised and presented for easy access and navigable. The importance of hypertext and presenting information clearly will create a more inclusive and connected web.
                        <p></p> <h2>My Reflection on Internet Histories-</h2> Offers valuable insights into the power of human modernization and collaboration. The internet was a simple system that shared research and was steadily developed into what we know today. The internet of today progressively increased throughout the years in countless diverse forms of websites. The multitude became interested in this technological phenomenon and wanted to learn how to use, improve and create their own form of media or webpage on the internet. Billions of people around the world use the internet for communication, information exchange, work and simply just to make their everyday lifestyle easier by using blogs, video content, social media, discussion forums, etc. The aspects of responsibility on the world wide web interact with advantages and disadvantages such as open standard accessibility and user privacy. Dynamic webpages allow a user to experience content that interests them, but this can allow the exploitation of personal data online by considering their locations. The internetâ€™s past and present still have ongoing challenges and shortcomings such as online harassment and the digital divide. This is interesting as this powerful testament also highlights the responsibility and transformation that the internet may undergo to remain revolutionary for a better future.
