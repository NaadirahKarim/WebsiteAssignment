                    <p>
                        <h2>Goal Alignment-</h2> My goal for my website is to give my users an experience that entails not only easy navigation, effective interface, user-friendly and operational elements but also to portray most of my personality through my website. The users I aimed this website at besides my marker would be my peers and most importantly would be used for future internship programmes. My content is based on the course and the development of my website.
                        <p></p><h2>Information Structure-</h2> This comes into relation with my wireframe planning as I would like some areas to be more separated than others. I have had to change some of my decisions once I started building my website. I aimed to create my website to be clean and simple.
                        <p></p><h2>User Flow-</h2> My user's movement is not necessarily in chronological order. My user has the freedom to explore my webpages by choosing what content they would like to look at by simply using the navigation bar and the interaction points such as buttons.
                        <p></p><img src="./images/Userflow.jpg" class="imgmain2" alt=" Information Structure and User Flow Representated as a Mind Map">  
                        <h3>Information Structure and User Flow Representated as a Mind Map</h3> 
                        <p></p><h2>Interface Elements-</h2> I used input controls the most as my interaction points, my website is simple and requires simple interface elements to enhance better a better user experience.
                        <p></p><h3>Buttons</h3> Commonly used in many websites, I made a “More About Me” button that takes the user to my profile webpage. I’ve made “Read More” buttons to access my whole blog posts. Similarly, I’ve created “Check Out” buttons to access my detailed design processes under specific headings in my design section. 
                        <p></p><h3>Icons-</h3> These icons are more for presentation layout for the blog, design, and profile section. They are used to enhance the aesthetic I was going for to make the website visually appealing and calming. I have used Icons from FontAwsome such as the burger icon and the upward arrow icon.
                        <p></p><h3>Toggles-</h3> I used the burger button in my website for a slider navigation menu. This can only be accessed when the screen is sized down to about 858pixels of max-width. I made this in response to mobile responsive layouts for users to be able to access my website on not only their desktop but their smaller devices as well.
                        <p></p><h3>Navigation-</h3> I have made a Navigation bar with text rather than icons as I didn’t want to use any icons that could potentially confuse my user once they started exploring my website. I added a footer to my website for decoration, the footer is visible on all the webpages except the blog and design posts because the posts are part of the section page and not on its own, unlike the profile page, where the portfolio project sections are a seperate indication to my profile.
                        <p></p><h2>Style Process Documentation-</h2> I used YouTube to browse videos or website designs especially when it came to how I wanted my blog and design overview sections to look like. I used Pinterest to attain inspiration from minimalistic aesthetic posts that had pastel colours and adopted my own art for my icons, logo, and background art. My wireframes are based on websites that visited, which were portfolio websites on wix. My wireframe images are resized.
