                    <p>
                        <h2>My Continuous Website Development-</h2> Has been intriguing. After watching some of the HTML YouTube videos and the lecture videos, I have been analysing the different functions, containers and classes that interconnect the HTML script and the CSS script for my website. I am fascinated by the idea that a type-up of code can display a variety of colours, text fonts, shapes, etc. Which is presented assorted to provide information through a user experience of the script's interface in the form of a website for a user. As I develop my website, I keep in mind the importance of responsive design, as this will be responsible for the UI and UX. In terms of my implimentation plans for my website. After researching online portfolio websites and browsing YouTube. I definitely want my design layout to be simple and clear, especially as a beginner website developer. My colour ideas are still all over the place but I would love to portray some of my personality through purple's and blues. Some challengers I have faced so far are designing my layout wireframes for my website. So many ideas but am I able to pull them off? So I am still deciding how I would like my blog, design and profile & portfolio section to showcase. I would like to enable majority of the pros of interaction and convention in my website. I already have an idea of how I want my navigation bar to work, using some inpiration from Andre's leacture video. I am enthusiastic to learn and adapt JavaScript to the whole process of web development. As I learn and improve on my latest skill with practice and dedication, I will be able to create dynamic and engaging websites that are functional, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly. 
                        <p></p><h2>My Reflection Week 3's Content Connecting With UI and UX-</h2> After reading <b>Mailloux's article, “Convention and Context”</b> and attending the lecture discussion. In UI design, conventions are used to create a sense of familiarity and relief for the user's navigation. By placing creative interface elements that are engaging and easy to use. Mailloux's article reminds us that conventions must be understood in the context they are being used. Thus, appropriate UI conventions should be used to design websites. Mailloux's emphasis on interactivity is related to UX. Interactivity is a key aspect to the modern digital environment which comes with its pros and cons. Users engage with the UI which in turn relates to the User's experience as an outcome. Interactivity in UI should be designed to support and enhance the user's goals and expectations. This can also be related to the lecture discussion on the significance of interaction design in creating effective websites and how important creating a user-friendly interface associate to a positive user experience.
                        <p></p><h2>Interactions and Conventions Pros and Cons-</h2> Pros including responsiveness and feedback. Users expect a quick response time and feedback when interacting with digital products, by ensuring your website responds quickly and efficiently with visual cues such as colour, text based messages and shapes is critical for user input. Another would be intuitive design as the interface should be easy to operate, and the layout should be clear, simple and logical, making it easy for users to navigate through ones website. One more being personalization, where users have personalized experiences through the content they are being recommended in accordance to user behaviour and emotional response.
                        <p></p><b>Cons</b> involving poor design decisions which could lead to user becoming frustrated and confused with inconsistent navigation and lack of feedback resulting in a poor user experience. Pop-ups and advertisements can be intrusive and distracting, disrupting the user experience and can lead to user emotional behaviour such as annoyance, irritation and even anger.
                        <p></p><h2>My Perspective on the Supplementary Material</h2> I have found it extremely helpful to use the supplementary resources, as this provides a wider scope of perspective, especially from the students and lecturers who had to move and adapt to the online environment due to covid. I find the extra resources beneficial when reviewing concepts of the readings or lecture content I didn’t fully grasp, as well as gaining a more in-depth understanding of the coding concepts of the course with the flexibility of learning within my time management. Although this is week 3, the recent in-person/online discussions have been instrumental in applying the course concepts to real-world scenarios, as well as gaining insight on my peer's opinions and the opportunity to clarify any questions I have.
