                    <h1>Internet, Society and Design Justice / Web APIs</h1>
                    <p>
                        <h2>My Continuous Website Development: APIs-</h2><p>API means <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong>, which are a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. An API basically acts as a messenger that enables two or more software systems to exchange information and performs specific functionalities. A standardised way of software components to interact, regardless of their underlying implementation or programming language is being provided.</p> 
                        <p>APIs come in different forms, including web APIs which are widely used for web-based communication. Web APIs is typically exposed over the internet and allow applications to interact by sending HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and receiving responses in various formats like JSON or XML. APIs are commonly used in various contexts, such as web development, mobile app development, and system integration. They enable developers to leverage existing functionalities and data from external services or applications without having to build everything from scratch. By using APIs, developers can save time, effort, and resources by reusing code and integrating third-party services. Hence, APIs form a crucial role in enabling in integrating, developing, and building software interoperability.</p>

                        <h2>Reading Reflection on <cite><a href="https://designjustice.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/ap8rgw5e/release/1"><em><q>Traveling While Trans</q></em></a></cite> by Costanza-Chock-</h2><p class="p-name">This article by Costanza-Chock raises various concerns such as the discriminatory nature of design choices in airport security systems and their impact on marginalized communities. Specifically, it addresses the biases embedded within millimetre wave scanning technology, which disproportionately affects individuals who do not conform to traditional gender norms. The author reflects on personal experiences of being flagged and subjected to additional searches based on these biased systems, highlighting how discrimination intersects with factors such as race, religion, immigration status, and disability.</p>
                        <p>The broader implications of biased design practices in the context of artificial intelligence <dfn>(AI)</dfn> development are one of the major concerns brought up. It argues that if AI systems are trained on biased data, they will only perpetuate and amplify societal biases, further marginalizing already vulnerable populations. To counteract this, the article introduces the Design Justice Network and its principles, which advocate for inclusive and collaborative design practices that prioritize community impact over designer intentions.</p>
                        <p>The Design Justice Network challenges the prevailing narratives of design for good or social impact design by recognizing the need to address systemic inequalities and power dynamics. It reframes the role of designers as facilitators and encourages a more democratic and accountable design process. The article acknowledges the broader movement of design justice and its intersection with fields like architecture, data science, and technology, emphasizing the growing community of practitioners working to transform design practices to address issues of inequality and racial justice.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the multifaceted nature of design, highlighting its universal practice in human communities as well as its professionalized field with specific expertise and associations are explored. It underscores the importance of recognizing marginalized people's design practices and challenges the dominant narratives of design theory and history. The article emphasizes the intersectionality of design, acknowledging the interlocking systems of race, class, and gender, and the need for a more inclusive and equitable approach.</p>
                        <p>The concept of the matrix of domination is introduced, drawing on the work of Black feminist scholar Patricia Hill Collins. It refers to the interlocking systems of oppression based on race, class, and gender. The article emphasizes that individuals both experience privilege and penalty within this matrix, which operates at personal, community, and institutional levels. Design justice is presented to challenge the matrix of domination by seeking equitable distribution of design's benefits, community participation in design decisions, and recognition of diverse design traditions.</p>
                        <p>The article connects design justice to intersectional feminist movements and their efforts for social justice. It suggests that design justice can provide tools for critiquing and documenting community-led design practices aligned with social movements. </p>
                        <p>By offering a comprehensive overview of the matrix of domination and design justice, the article underscores the need to address structural inequalities and oppressive systems in design practices. It effectively explains how race, class, and gender intersect as systems of oppression and shape individuals' experiences. </p>
                        <p>The concept of design justice adds a crucial dimension to the discussion, emphasizing the role of design in either perpetuating or challenging the matrix of domination. Through its focus on equitable distribution, community participation, and recognition of diverse design traditions, design justice offers a framework for promoting social justice through design. The article's connection to intersectional feminist movements further underscores the relevance and timeliness of design justice as a concept. Overall, the article serves as a thought-provoking reflection on the potential of design to contribute to a more equitable and just society.</p>
