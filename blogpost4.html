                <h2>Interaction Design for the Web / JavaScript Fundamentals</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>My continuous website development-</b> Learning JavaScript this week was engrossing. I had prior experience with coding languages that had a similar format, so I understood most of the content from the exercise taught in the technical lecture. This week I tried to do more research on JavaScript as well as tried to experiment with code that I could potentially use for my website in the future, I will not be using JavaScript in my first assignment to prevent myself from going into hyper stress when code starts to break my design (LOL). As for my development of my website, I have finally got an idea about how I want to design my blog and design sections while also using an overview page to allow users to have chance to choose what section they would like to experience. My portfolio section still remains a mystery. I am very indecisive of whether I want both my profile and projects on the same page, making two different pages, or making a profile page that has project placeholders for my portfolio. I also have decided that I wanted to make my own backgrounds and icons for my webiste. I wanted to go all out in a beginner friendly way, hopefully all works out. In terms of my coding skills, I have always tried to use what know when coding, sometimes my semantic mark will be the same, sometimes its completely different because I wanted to experiment and the experiment was a success. I am however enthusiastic to learn and experience more about how JavaScript interconnects with HTML and CSS to create an operational and appealing display of websites. 
                     <br><br> <b>Your wireframes hold up against the readings and lectures on UI-</b> Before the readings and this week’s lecture, I had a standard and simple idea of my draft wireframe design in terms of my homepage and about page. I had based most of my design on another website without much detail. After the lecture, my perspective of what I desired for my website was mostly butchered. I had to revise my wireframe per the UI and what I want my user to experience. This is truly a tricky concept to fully grasp as I honestly don’t know what I want my user to experience, yet. Who is my target audience of users? What would interest them in my website? These questions need to be answered for the development of my website overall. Therefore, I have placed myself in the perspective of the user so I may answer these questions to design my UI and wireframe effectively, for a pleasant user experience.
                     <br><br> <b> The UI relation to the interactivity definition from last week</b> From last week, I know interactivity is a powerful tool for UI design. I may repeat what is already known but to me interactivity and UI go hand in hand to provide engagement for the user to be satisfied. The interface is an exchange barrier between a user and the system which authorizes and characterizes interaction for a productive experience. Interactivity within the UI requires balance, too much can be overwhelming but too little can be frustrating which is one of the cons of interaction and convention. Modern-day users all around the world expect the UI of any app or website to be quick and responsive with effective feedback. UI design is used to guide and advise user experience in development and improvement. Thus, accessibility and useability are important fundamentals for UI and UX.
                     <br><br> <b>My Reflection on "The Basic Principles of User Interface Design" and "Gibson - 2004 - Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology” readings</b> After reading both "The Basic Principles of User Interface Design.pdf" and "Gibson - 2004 - Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology.pdf, there was a clear understanding that both have different perspectives on user interface design, yet they both have the same focus on improving user experience. The former article focuses on the principles of design that are essential elements of design, whilst the other article is based on alternative approaches to UI technology which are clear and available to understand. Both articles provide clear perspectives that the UI should be designed by the user’s satisfaction. Due to technological advancements new usability challenges and new interface designs are recognized. Thus, both articles provide valuable insights into the complexity and dynamics of UI design as well as how the basic principles and technology can make interface designs enjoyable for users.
