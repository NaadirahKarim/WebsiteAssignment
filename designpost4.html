                    <p></p>
                    <h2>How Does The Code Impact The UX and UI of This Website-</h2>
                    <p>I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this website. My folder structure does reflect my content through Hierarchical Information Structure. All three coding languages separate in layers. Data layer represents the HTML code, the logic layer represents the JavaScript code, and the presentation layer represents the CSS code. My naming conventions are modular and scalable as they are usually my headings are sized at 30pixels- 15pixels the paragraph text is usually sized at 15pixels-12pixels. The naming conventions are linked to the name of the section. I have tried to use consistent tag containers and styling conventions throughout the website in terms of positioning, font sizes, margin sizes etc.</p>
                    <p>My markup is providing enough information for a user to use browser to access my website. The believe the interface elements and the content are expressed fully and correctly allowing users easy navigation throughout the website.  The usability is portrayed through accessibility, clarity, and responsive design. Accessibility can be improved through more media queries. </p>
                    <p>The JavaScript codes do express interaction points through the buttons, the links, and the wireframe gallery. The array type and the convert from HTML to JavaScript innerHTML are repeated. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get all the code to separate and consolidate. Yes, I have made various JavaScript’s that link through the HTML. I have tried my best in async requests to decrease redownloading and to improve the overall performance of the UX and UI. Sadly, I was still struggling with DOM JavaScript up until the end.</p>
                    <p>The CSS scripts are linked to the HTML preventing in-line styles and I tried my best to maintain consistent styling methods throughout the website. The code is modular and maintainable. I have adapted responsive layouts of screen sizes in response to the desktop size (1440pixels), tablet size (768pixels) and mobile phone medium-size (375pixels). I have implemented my HTML and CSS codes in a way that provides effective impact in the UI and UX systems functionally and intuitively.</p>
                    
                    <p></p>
                    <h2>Changes Made From Assignment 1 For Assignment 3-</h2>
                    <p>This is a reflection on the implementation and appearance changes that I made to this website from Assignment 1's feedback. I will be mentioning responsive design choices I have made along with how I implemented Document Object Model (DOM) in relation to the HTML and CSS I have used. The feedback that was provided from assignment 1 was extremely helpful and insightful for the improvements I have incorporated.</p>
                    <h3>Appearance of User Interface <dfn>(UI)</dfn> And User Experience <dfn>(UX)</dfn>- </h3><p>Appearance wise I took the advice from the provided feedback and made a return button that is like the scroll to the top button I had implemented for assignment 1. This button allows the user to return to the overview page of the section they are on which is either the blog section or design section. In these sections I have created a “next page” button. Instead of the words “next” and “back”, I used arrows instead, this displays a more pleasing interaction with the buttons. The back button now refers to the previous blog rather than to the overview page. Taking lecturer Hanli Geyser's advice into account I made sure to always keep the navigation bar visible on all pages. This allows a user to not have to scroll right to the top to change the webpage. The scroll to top button is still present.</p>
                    <p>The gallery for the wireframe images has been changed as well. Users can now click onto images to view them much larger while using a slider to view each image without having to back and click on each image individually. With these images I have added the alt text along with captions to indicate what the image represents, which I had gullibly forgot to add for assignment 1. Throughout the website I have increased the font size where needed and sized down the fonts in accordance with the media queries.</p>
                    <p>I have changed my homepage and portfolio page a bit. I simply put the image icon from the portfolio profile section to the homepage as that image’s purpose is to showcase who I am. Overall, I did not try to change a lot of the appearance of the website as I am content with the way most of the webpages look, besides the portfolio page which needs some work. I have added my assignment 2 essay to the essay webpage as well as blogs for weeks 8-13.</p>
                    <h3>Code In HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and DOM-</h3><p>Taking the feedback from assignment 1 into account I managed to replace and add what was needed. A grave mistake I had made was not layering out proper ordered syntax, I mistakenly forgot to add the header and main syntax which is common knowledge yet slipped my mind which of course costed me marks. In addition to taking responsibility for the syntax error I have replaced microformats along with the tags "br" and "div" which was another error I had made in assignment 1 which can cause accessibility problems. I have used "p" and "section" mostly across my website. I have added metaformats such as "u-photo", "u-url", "u-email", "p-name" and "p-card" I have also added the alt text to images as mentioned above as well as tried making the referencing links actual links. The <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn"><em>MDN Web Doc</em></a></cite> is a great resource for beginner web developers like me.</p>
                    <p>The new additions I have added to my website in terms of JavaScript are the gallery for the wireframe images which I have mentioned above. I have also added an appearance animation as well as a search bar. Unfortunately, these 2 scripts are ready to be used but there were some issues I was facing with other elements of the website so for now they are currently “hidden” on the website. The search bar will, hopefully be used in accordance with an API I would like to administer.</p>
                    <p>DOM of JavaScript was one of my biggest challenges for this assignment. I don't think I did a good job, and I will improve on this skill over time. I have made DOM of JavaScript with the navigation bar, blog post overview page using an array, design gallery section, and the essay. My navigation bar was creating an issue when I did the DOM in the "all.js" script. I am not confident in my JavaScript skills hence why this is one of the biggest risks in losing marks for this assignment.</p>
                    <h3>Media Queries-</h3><p>From assignment 1, I learnt that the media query sizes I used were not utilised in the correct manner. I decided that I would use 4 different screen size resolutions: 1500px, 800px, 500px and 400px. The 850px were part of the codes from assignment 1, hence why that code is still present in the CSS scripts. The 1500px screen resolution should enable a person using a laptop of (1440pixels) screen size to view the website without any worries. The 800px screen resolution can accommodate a tablet size of (768pixels) and the (400pixels) screen resolution will be used to size down a mobile phone screen of (375pixels-320pixels) allowing for easy on the go access. These screen size resolutions are beneficial to the user as they can experience this website wherever they are on any device that accommodates these sizes creating a friendly user experience.</p>
                    <p>I really did enjoy this course and learnt quite a couple of new skills I will gladly improve upon. Doing these assignments, essays and blogs gave me insight on how the world works with technology especially with regards to the world wide web and its responsibilities. I do hope I will present a very great website that incorporates all the necessary user interface elements needed to provide a relaxed user experience.</p>
                    
                    <p></p>
                    <h2>Changes Made From Assignment 3 For The Exam-</h2>
                    <p>This is a reflection on the implementation and appearance changes I made to my website based on the feedback from Assignment 3 for the exam. I will outline the modifications and additions I made to each section of my website, as well as the changes I made to the JavaScript DOM. I have incorporated the necessary improvements from Assignment 3 in preparation for the exam.</p>
                    <h3>API Additions- </h3><p>I integrated two APIs into my website for additional functionality. I included a motivational quote API and a custom Google search engine API. I selected the motivational quote API with the aim of providing users with indirect motivation through the quotes they encounter. These generated quotes could potentially offer the encouragement they need to overcome personal challenges. I placed this API in the portfolio section of my website to showcase my dedication, as I often utilized motivational quotes to stay motivated while working on various projects.Initially, I intended to implement a custom search engine API that would search only within the content and topics of my website. However, due to time constraints, I was unable to figure out the implementation details, so I settled for a custom Google search engine API which I found via a <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTlPsZ8rllk"><em>YouTube</em></a></cite> video. This allows users to search the web while on my website, enabling them to find articles or definitions related to blog posts or design sections, thereby expanding their knowledge on topics of interest.</p>
                    <h3>Updates To Each Section:</h3>
                    <p>In the Design Section, I made updates to the theory throughout the various sections. I included the final exam wireframes, expanded on the IxD process, and included a style guide. These changes, along with the reflection from Assignment 3 to the exam, are detailed in the Implementation notes. The updates encompass design choices that were modified, added, or removed.</p>
                    <p>I made slight changes to the appearance of my Portfolio Page. The homepage now features an icon profile picture instead of the portfolio page. The overall layout and appearance of the portfolio page remained the same, but I added a new placeholder for 3D modelling projects. Within this placeholder, users can view pictures showcasing the 3D projects I have created, with access provided via a GitHub link. I also added another game to the game's placeholder, along with its respective GitHub repository link. The format remains consistent with previous placeholders, including a description of the game and images depicting different scenes from the game.</p>
                    <p>I did not make any changes to the Blog section. However, I added a new blog post titled "Semester Reflection," which serves as a brief write-up about what I have learned during the course of this semester. It also includes expressions of gratitude to those who have provided me with opportunities to acquire knowledge.</p>
                    <p>To accommodate the two essays, I made my Essay section similar to the Blog section in terms of the overview. I created an Essay icon for the essay placeholders. The essays themselves can be easily viewed by clicking the "read more" button.</p>
                    <h3>Overall Adjustments To The Website-</h3><p>I retained the same media queries as before, accommodating desktop (1440 pixels), tablet (768 pixels), and medium-sized mobile devices (375 pixels). I also included in-text referencing and metadata tags. In response to the feedback from Assignment 3, I added more metadata tags and included in-text referencing for improved content organization.</p>
                    <h3>Code In HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT DOM-</h3><p>

                        After analyzing the feedback received for assignment 3, I made efforts to enhance the areas that needed improvement. Each section of the assignment is associated with two or more JavaScript functions. I established a connection between the navigation buttons in the HTML and the corresponding JavaScript code by linking the website link to the buttons. Additionally, I utilized the innerHTML DOM method for certain portions of each section. I also attempted to incorporate the array prototype, but I faced difficulties in making it work properly on my website, leading to confusion. I intend to continue refining my JavaScript skills, as I possess a grasp of the fundamentals but struggle with their correct implementation. I aspire to create more websites or further enhance the current one.</p>
