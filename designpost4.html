                <p>
                    I have only used HTML and CSS for this website. My folder structure is created from placing each webpages information in one folder. For example, all blog HTML scripts, and blog CSS script is placed in one folder, the index.html and style.css scripts are placed in a folder called homepage and so on for the other sections. These folders are in a chronological order. I have used presentation layer when coding the different sections. My semantic markup does provide sufficient context and information to the browser. The interface elements and content are expressed fully and correctly.  The usability is portrayed through accessibility, clarity, and mobile responsiveness. Although accessibility, SEO and consistency can be improved on. I have tried to use consistent tag containers and styling conventions throughout the website in terms of positioning, font sizes, margin sizes etc. My CSS codes are more scalable with modular aspects, but I hope I can make my websites maintainable soon. I have tried to adapt the responsive layouts of screen sizes, some websites have a fantastic response to sizing down the screen, others not so much but this is due the width as I have not considered all the possible screen sizes, only two others. On my wireframe page, my images are coded to be fully viewed when click on them, unfornately the exit button when one image is in full view is not visible, yrtthere is code present for the exit button which is commented out. Users are advised to use the brower back button to return to the wireframe gallery and art gallery which are the only two places this feature is used. I have implimented my HTML and CSS codes in a way that provides effective impact in the UI and UX systems functionally and intuitively.
