                    <h1>IxD Process Mashup & Ethics of UX Practice / JavaScript</h1>
                    <p>
                        <h2>My Experience With My Website Development-</h2><p>My experience during this assignment journey in all honesty with all the headaches I've had when my design or my code refused to co-operate with me, I found that I truly enjoyed creating my website. I literally created a website from scratch, that is truly mind blowing as I never thought I would be able to make something like this. I have made a decision to use a minimal amount of colour on my website but I would like my website to portray some of my personality while also keeping in mind the user interface and user experience of not only my marker but also just anyone who would like to check out my website.</p>  
                        <h2>IxD UI UX Process: (Click Design For More Details)</h2> 
                        <h3>Goal Alignment-</h3> <p>My goal for my website is to give my users an experience that entails not only easy navigation, effective interface, and user-friendly elements but also to portray most of my personality through my website, not only in my portfolio profile. The users I aimed this website at besides my marker would be my peers but also internship programmes for my future. My content is based on the course and well the building of this website.</p>
                        <h3>Information Structure and User Flow-</h3> <p>I want my information to be spaced out in some areas and together in other. This comes into relation with my wireframe planning and when I started building my website. Clear and simple.My user's movement is not necessarily in chronological order. My user has the freedom to explore my webpages by choosing what page they would like to see, or what content they would like to look at first.</p> 
                        <h3>Interface Elements-</h3> <p>I am using input controls more than the others, my website is simple and requires simple interface elements that will make the user experience clear and intuitive. Having to many interface components at my beginner level will overwhelm me and my website will probably unmanageable (worst case scenario).</p>
                        <h3>Design-</h3> <p>I've had trouble finalising my wireframe designs, thus having to go back to re-adjust or to try new concepts that will make the flow of my website smooth and enjoyable. My portfolio profile section is another section I've been experimenting with as I want my profile to be unique but also familiar to users for navigation.</p> 
                        <h2>The Reading Reflections-</h2> <p class="p-name">After reading <b>Hassenzahl and Tractinsky's 2006 paper <cite><a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/ui-design-principles/"><em><q>User Experience - A Research Agenda</q></em></a></cite></b> user experience design is the main topic. The reading provided an insightful overview of user experience is relation to traditional usability concerns to examine emotional and social aspects of user interaction with products and services. The author's definition of UX as a momentary, primarily feeling of interacting with a product or a service made me realize that UX is not just about functionality but also about the user's emotional response from the interaction. Understanding the userâ€™s needs, emotions and expectations of a design is extremely important to reach a developer's goal, this is not only in terms of website development.</p>
                        <p class="p-name">After going through the <b><cite><a href="https://ulwazi.wits.ac.za/courses/49199/pages/the-ethics-of-ux-practice?module_item_id=470244"><em><q>Ethics of UX Practice</q></em></a></cite></b>, ethical considerations in the design process are important for user privacy, autonomy, and people well-being. I am now more aware of ethical implications of any of my work which has inspired me to make these decisions to better my website.</p>
