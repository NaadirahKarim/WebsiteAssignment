                    <h1>Imagining the Internet / HTML Fundamentals</h1>
                    <p>
                        <h2>Setting up Github-</h2> <p>desktop was simple as I am fairly familiar with Github and how the programme functions. I have used the Github website to obtain resources for previous projects I have done, however I have not used the software to upload or share resources. I used different forms of online media such as the Google search, the Ulwazi Interactive Media IIIA course Github tutorial video and YouTube to improve my knowledge on how the desktop version operates, which was identical to the website version. Setting up Github desktop was a great experience to assist in improving my awareness of how I would use this platform.</p>
                        <h2>The Reading Reflections-</h2><p> The readings contained outstanding insight on how the internet operates now a days and how the idea that overwhelming knowledge is absorbed by us human beings and adapted in our everyday lives. Overwhelming knowledge is one of the biggest topics represented throughout all three reading and allowed my mind to have a change in perspective about the world we live in. As it is without this cyberspace, would we have had access to these pieces of literature.</p>
                        <p><b><cite><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/"><em>As We May Think</em></a></cite></b> is a story about <strong class="p-name">Vannevar Bush</strong>, an American engineer that was able to predict the future of technology which was the development of the web and how the system would be able to provide the world with unlimited access to knowledge by recording, retrieving, and sharing. The memex system was built like a human mind but with permanent available record of research coordinated and stored in one place. Without his predictions the world wide web that we know of today would probably have not existed and this is mind-blowing to know that was able to design and build his predictions.</p>
                        <p><b><cite><a href="https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf"><em>The Library of Babel</em></a></cite></b> was intriguing and emphasized just how significant knowledge is and how even before the internet was established, the way people attained and utilized that knowledge. The website version of this piece is a brilliant example. Already after reading the description of the <q>Library </q> you may feel stupendous. Only realizing after I completed reading the piece of work that the world wide web was identical. In my opinion the books represent the different websites on the internet and the librarians are us the people that use the internet every single day, hence the library of babel and the internet are similar in many aspects.</p>
                        <p><b><cite><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5420be03e4b0256ed58560d1/t/59acb5c6ff7c50083fd9ea7a/1504491464221/Borges_Garden+of+Forking+Path.pdf"><em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em></a></cite></b> is a detective story in which the reader is a detective which had intensely given me the realization that the web just like the book could easily become a labyrinth of hyperlinked puzzles and E-libraries, unsolvable with alternate dimensions and timelines. Both Borges's passages and his libraries highlight how unorganized and chaotic all this knowledge is presented which will instantly making you feel overwhelmed, unlike the internet which had google initially organize all this information for easy access. In modern times the internet can be viewed as a book filled with eternal information.</p>
                        <h2>My Goals For This Course-</h2><p> include acquiring knowledge on the different coding languages that allows websites to be designed, built, and used as well as learning more about developing my own profile website. Im excited for this course as it entails how creating websites and interacting with different forms of media on the internet can assist in improving my skills as a developer in the digital world.</p>
