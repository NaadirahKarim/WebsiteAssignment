                            <p>

                            <p>
                                In terms of colour theory, the colours blue, white, and black are used for this website's layout allows the user to feel comfortable and relaxed while they do their online shopping. the blue colour is known as colour #1E81B0 which is bright blue and is used throughout the website. <q>Blue is most often associated with loyalty and trust. Blue is the most universally liked colour in the world, which may explain why so many companies opt for blue shades for their branding.</q> <em>(Taso Du Val, 2010) </em>. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The website's product webpages are formed to provide users with all the necessary information they need before making a purchase. This includes various product images with the price and reviews from previous customers. The product images are of high quality and can be zoomed in, allowing users to analyse the product before making a purchasing decision.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Some of the greatest UI features of Takealot.com include the cart icon, heart icon, and checkout process. The heart icon is represented as the user's product wish list. The wish list allows users to "heart"/save a product they find intriguing for a later purchase. The cart icon is always visible, guaranteeing that users can keep track of the number of purchases they would like to proceed with. The checkout can be accessed with a click of a button.

User's can also access their recent purchased delivery through the Order's webpage. These aspects of UI provide users with an emotionally calm and comfortable user experience. <q>As the evolution of UI design advances, end users have become more demanding and consequently so has the role of the UI designer.</q> <em>(Taso Du Val, 2010)</em>  Takealot.com has successfully adapted change to the UI demands providing successful UI and UX.

                            <p>
                                Due to recent technological enhancements, the user experience (UX) design of the Takealot.com website is a critical factor in its growth and success in the competitive e-commerce industry. The website was developed to ensure online shopping is a breeze to conduct. The UI of Takealot.com is functionally optimized to enhance user experience, ensuring that navigation throughout the website is made clear, quick, and easy to understand. The website's load time is swift, providing users with a seamless shopping experience. The most common reason for a slow load time would be poor internet connection from the service provider.                           
                            </p> 

                            <p>
                                 The sort by departments feature is a great navigation element for UX. Whether users are searching for a specific item or a range of items in a specific category these product categories are fantastic as the user is allowed to go through diverse options of that item with a mere push of two buttons and some scrolling.
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>
                                According to <strong>Hassenzahl and Tractinsky's 2006 paper <q>User Experience - A Research Agenda</q></strong> , user experience is not just operated functionally but mainly through emotional behaviour. This is represented through the colour theory. The bright blue against the white instigates the user to feel trust and loyalty. The trust indicates the protection of a user's details as well as recommendations for future purchases. Loyalty from the blue represents customers returning to purchase from Takealot.com to increase sales.
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>
                               One of the best UX features of Takealot.com, both the website and the app is the personalized product recommendation section. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms to analyse the user's search and purchase history, allowing personalized product recommendations. This essential feature not only elevates the user experience but also increases the likelihood of repeat business through customer loyalty.
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>
                                The platform offer's a customer support section that is exemplary, including a well-crafted comprehensive FAQ section that addresses answers to frequently asked questions. Another feature users can access is a real-time live chat support system that connects users with knowledgeable customer support agents, securing effective solutions to any concerns customers experience.

                        <article>
                            <p>
                                Takealot.com was launched on the web in June 2011. The interaction and conventional design of the Takealot.com website is overall ethical, with the plan to provide a positive and satisfactory user experience. Takealot describes itself as a <q>retail business who strives to have a wide range of products and sets its focus on having the best possible customer service on African continent.</q> <em>(Ried, 2011)</em>  Regarding <strong>Steven Mailloux's article, <q>Convention and Context,</q></strong>  Takealot.com has adhered to UI conventions allowing users to interactive with them supporting an engaging UX. 
                                The rise of Covid-19 in 2020 caused Takealot.com to experience a surge in demand, as customers alternated to e-commerce for essential goods when lockdown regulations and social distancing measures were declared. Reflecting from  <strong><q>The Basic Principles of User Interface Design.pdf</q> and Gibson - 2004 - <q>Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology.pdf</q></strong> , Takealot has taken into consideration UI design and technology through the pandemic era. The company had to adapt quickly to this sudden change while facing pressurization with the safety of their employees and customers as well as maintaining fair prices while avoiding excessive pricing throughout the platform using intuitive UI methods for positive responses and feedback. 
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>
                                Takealot.com's response to the pandemic's implementation protocols of strict health and safety measures with all persons interacting with the company was crucial. In the warehouses and delivery operations, the protocols included social distancing measures, increased sanitation and hygiene practices, the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE), and contactless delivery and collection including no signature required. Hence, these regulations increased the capacity to meet the surge in demand and prevented the pandemic from spreading even further.
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>
                                One of the ethical considerations Takealot.com had to ensure was that there was an engagement in profiteering during the virus spread. This concern was conducted due to numerous reports detailing that e-commerce platforms and retailers benefiting from the widespread inflated prices. Takealot.com addressed these reports stating. <q>The situation is being closely monitored and in cases where prices are deemed to have been exorbitantly increased, Takealot.com is committed to engaging with the relevant sellers.</q> <em> (Ried, 2011)</em>.  
                                However, some customers have raised concerns about this statement with the importance of scrutiny and transparency for online shopping platforms to act ethically during the pandemic. Hence, Takealot.com's response to the Covid-19 pandemic can be viewed positively from an ethical perspective.
                            </p>
                               
                            <p>
                                The website's privacy policy is transparent, informing users of how their data is collected and used. While also using secure sockets layer <dfn>(SSL)</dfn>  encryption, ensuring that protection for all the user's data is present. Yet, there have been some ethical concerns with the site's interaction design. The personalized product recommendation section could be seen as intrusive to some users, as their data is being used to influence their purchasing decisions. Takealot.com has asserted that user privacy and data protection are important as there is a need for transparency and accountability. The wish list feature is also linked to this interaction design as recommendations are shown based on a user's wish list items. 
                                The user should also be aware that the items placed on the wish list are not always available for purchase. While this feature enhances the user experience, it raises questions about data privacy and the ethics of using customer data for commercial gain.
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>
                                Another ethical concern that is made aware by users is the website's pricing strategy. This is not only in consideration of the Covid-19 era but also to present times as well. The issue features products that are priced higher than their competitors in the e-commerce retail industry. While this is not directly violating ethical standards, this can be viewed as misleading and deceptive to users who are not aware of the price differences across platforms. The pricing situation can also be correlated to the product's quality being displayed on Takealot.com as some products are not priced to their value which may mislead customers, resulting in a negative response and feedback, especially with products that have negative or no reviews on the product page.

                            <p>
                                In conclusion, the Takealot.com website is a well-crafted e-commerce platform that is designed to provide users with an enjoyable and comfortable user experience. The website's user interface portrays a seamless and uncluttered design, while the user experience has been optimized and personalized for quick and meticulously effective response feedback.
