                    <h1>The World in www / Semantic Markup</h1>
                    <p>
                        <h2>Reflection on Submission of Assignment 1-</h2><p>This week I submitted assignment 1 which was a huge relief and most importantly I did enjoy building my website even with all my complaining when my code refused to listen to me and load shedding. A lot of the components I wanted my website to display are present, like the blog posts overview which took me a bit of time as I was learning how to make that format display in CSS code. I am happy with the result for both the design section and the blog section. I feel like my homepage is missing something, but I don’t really know what to add more. My profile and portfolio page also feels like the formatting needs changing up, whether I should make the profile and portfolio sections on different webpages or keep the placeholders the way they are, yet I am happy with the overall exhibit. I need to add in my game projects placeholder which is in my portfolio section. I was unable to make an exit “X” button on the screen when a user clicks onto the pictures for full view in the wireframe and art galleries and I do hope I can get a solution to this issue soon. I did struggle with my media queries. I am still figuring out what works and what doesn’t so for assignment 1 the down scaling screen size is out of place on some webpages. I will solve these problems soon along with starting my planning for assignment 3. </p> 
                        <h2>Reflection on the readings and how they impact your thinking about web dev as a South African-</h2> 
                        <h3>Digital Hegemonies The Localness of Search Engine.</h3> <p class="p-name">In the article <b><cite><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2017.1308240"><em><q>Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine,</q></em></a></cite> Ballatore et al. </b> points out the influence of search engines we use in our everyday lives and the understanding of the world around us. The argument of this article is based on the global reach of search engines like Google, local factors such as language, culture, and geography play a significant role in determining the information presented to us which is important in recognizing the limitations and biases inherent in search engines, which can lead to the reinforcement of dominant cultural and linguistic norms. As a user of various search engines, I as well as everyone who uses the web must be aware of these factors and work towards a more diverse and inclusive digital landscape. Thus, our digital experiences and the need for greater critical engagement with these technologies are extremely crucial for future generations to come.</p>
                        <h3>Towards a study of information geographies.</h3> <p class="p-name">In this paper <b><cite><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/geo2.8"><em><q>Towards a Study of Information Geographies,</q></em></a></cite> Graham et al. </b>argues that access to information and communication technologies <dfn>(ICTs)</dfn> is not evenly distributed around the world, and this digital divide has significant social, economic, and political implications. An introduction to the concept of "information geographies" is provided to understand how ICTs are formed and in turn create social and spatial relations. The understanding of the digital divide and its impact on different regions and communities are displayed in a very nuanced way. The authors of this article suggest that we should move beyond simplistic notions of a "global village" and instead recognize the complex ways in which ICTs are embedded in local contexts. By acknowledging the uneven distribution of information and the diverse ways in which ICTs are used, we can better address issues of inequality and work towards a more equitable and inclusive digital future.</p> 
                        <h3>How Does Both Articles Impact Web Development as a South African-</h3><p>While both the above articles convey different characteristics between digital technologies and geography, they do not directly focus on how this relationship impacts web development. As a South African, the content provided by both these articles is insightful and useful with how information is produced, available, accessed, and consumed through different search engines globally. Social and cultural aspects of the web provide different norms and values which is influenced by local cultural, political, and economic elements. Thus, by understanding how digital technologies are building information geographies, including the role of search engines and the many ways power and inequality are reproduced in the digital environment we can gain a greater understanding of web development and its impacts in South Africa and around the world.</p>
