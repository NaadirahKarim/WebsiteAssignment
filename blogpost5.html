                    <h1>Website Progress Reflection / DOM</h1>
                    <p>
                        <h2>Website Reflection-</h2> <p>This week I was balancing studying math for engineering along with completing my wireframes and planning for once I start building my website in the coming weeks. I kept on chopping and changing colours and fonts as I was undecisive of my overall website aesthetic. I decided that I wanted to go for a minimal aesthetic and my colours would be centred about blue and purples. Something might look great is theory but once practicality hits, the idea may turn into a complete flop. I am still experimenting with formatting, hence why wireframes are not complete.</p>
                        <h2>Extra Research Reflection-</h2> <p>To clear myself of stress I watch a documentary called <strong><q>The Social Dilemma</q></strong>  which was released by Netflix in 2020. I had heard about the documentary but never sat down to watch it until now. "The Social Dilemma" explores the negative impact of social media on society. The film argues that social media platforms, designed to keep users engaged and addicted, have become a threat to democracy, mental health, and privacy.</p>
                        <p>In relation to <dfn>(UI)</dfn> user interface and <dfn>(UX)</dfn> user experience, the documentary shows how social media platforms use these powerful elements to manipulate users' behaviour. The design of social media platforms is intended to be addictive, with features like notifications, likes, and shares triggering a dopamine response in the brain. Social media algorithms are designed to show users content that they are most likely to engage with, keeping them hooked to the app for longer periods by analyzing they everyday activity to show users similar content that they may interact with. Initially this was never meant to harm humans but to use the platforms to entertainment and to profit off the business.</p> 
                        <p>The documentary indicates how the design of social media platforms can lead to negative outcomes, such as mental health issues, polarization which could potentially lead to conspiracy theories which eventually leads to misinformation and <q>Fake News</q>. There are also concerns raised about the lack of transparency and accountability in the way social media platforms operate. Social media companies collect vast amounts of user data, which can be used to manipulate their behavior and preferences.</p>
                        <p>As a student web developer this was extremely insightful about modern day social media usage, whether with Artificial intelligence or human intelligence. This is a reminder that humans created A.I. A web developer has the power to influence how users interact with ethical implications of websites and applications. Secondly, as a beginner web developer, we've been focusing on the core aspects of UI and UX to create engaging and user-friendly digital products. From what I've learnt from this course so far understanding the principles of UX and UI design can help you create products that are intuitive, easy to use, and visually appealing, which will in term give emotional responses from users. Data and algorithms are important to consider as a developer as the potential ethical implications are designed to protect usersâ€™ privacy and well-being. The documentary emphasizes the need for greater transparency and accountability in the design and operation of digital products. This role can be played by us in advocating for greater transparency and ethical standards in the industry. This documentary was extremely eye opening for me considering that I would like to enter this industry some day and maybe change some aspects of social media that don't currently exist for a healthier life.</p>
