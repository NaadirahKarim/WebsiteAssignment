                        <p>This is a time-based Point-and-Click adventure puzzle game that was created by Naadirah. Karim and two other Digital Arts students. The goal of this game is to survive the different levels of the story by searching and obtaining information to make an antidote that will allow you (the player) to escape the asylum. Time is the players enemy as time represents your health level which will constantly be decreasing throughout the game, so make sure to keep an eye on the time and work as fast as possible to obtain your freedom. If the time runs out, you die.</p>
                        <p>The Electrical Room: enter this room after reading the newspaper, turn the electricity of the building on with the wire and switch box puzzles. The Doctors office, look around the room for sticky notes to help figure out the password to access the doctor’s desktop. The desktop contains information about the antidote and its ingredients chosen correctly if, not your time/health will decrease by a couple of seconds. The Lab, there are two puzzles, you have the option to either complete the puzzle and obtain the antidote OR select the correct ingredients to obtain the antidote. </p>
                        <p>In each room there will be a painkiller syringe to help increase your time (chance of survival) but you must still be quick as your choices are the most important. Sticky notes represent hints, so keep an eye out for them as well. The exit room requires a 3 number passcode so be weary as for what that could be in the available rooms.</p>
                        <p>WARNING: time is limited so choose carefully. An incorrect choice will cause your health time to decrease which can be crucial in winning the game. Good Luck & Don’t Die!</p>
